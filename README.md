## The Baba, the Me and the Keke
This is a custom level pack for [Baba is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/).

Heavily inspired by [The Good, The Bad and The Ugly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly), and westerns in general.

Currently a work in progress; released for playtesting / feedback.

Includes:

* 12 puffs, 4 blossoms, no bonuses
* Custom music track
* Custom word (shoot: fall in current facing direction)

See [REFERENCES](REFERENCES.md) for a partial list of assets and references (with minor spoilers).
